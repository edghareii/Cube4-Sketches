# Acknowledgments

The following lists sources for sketches, inspiration, and artefacts that I have used in creating the sketches.

## Freetronics 4x4x4 RGB Cube Forum
The [Freetronics 4x4x4 RGB Cube Forum](http://forum.freetronics.com/viewforum.php?f=32) has been a great source of ideas and sample sketches.

## Freetronics Cube4 Matrix
Original version created by user **ponch58**, and posted to [http://forum.freetronics.com/viewtopic.php?f=32&t=5562](). I've modified this version to include the position of each LED and the corners, as I use these features in a number of my sketches.

## Videos
Numerous videos have been posted that show animations running on a 4x4x4 cube. I used these as inspiration for many of my sketches. Three particularly useful videos are:-

* [4x4x4 Led cube demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adXXSitxPdo)
* [Arduino Uno 4x4x4 LED Cube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XplWwPg8Blk)
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jpL6jEuulk](4x4x4 LED Cube Light Show  Tutorial HD)
## Cubes
Part of the example sketches from the Cube4 Library. The original source is from the [Cubes](https://github.com/freetronics/Cube4/blob/master/examples/Cubes/Cubes.ino) sketch  **Blake Kus** (blakekus@gmail.com) released under the GPLv3.

My modification was to make a non blocking version.
