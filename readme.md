# Cube4 Sketches

This repository is a place for me to publish sketches that I or others have worked on for the [Freetronics 4x4x4 RGB LED Cube](http://www.freetronics.com.au/collections/kits/products/cube4-4x4x4-rgb-led-cube).

Please see the **Acknowledgments.txt** file for information on where I have sourced items from if I haven't created them myself.
